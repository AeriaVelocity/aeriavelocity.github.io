		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>Hi, I'm Arsalan, this is my personal website for stuff.</p>
		<p>I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture">hacker</a>, developer, modder and artist. I'm currently studying at <a href="https://www.westherts.ac.uk">West Herts College</a>.</p>
		<p>I mainly program in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C programming language</a>.</p>
		<p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN03oe-sc2iHqcTKf9fTwYQ">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.github.com/That1M8Head">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.twitter.com/That1M8Head">Twitter</a>.</p><h2></h2>
		<h2>My projects</h2>
		<p><a href="https://sonic-lockandload.github.io">Sonic: Lock & Load</a> - A mod for the GZDoom source port based on the Sonic the Hedgehog series, with a focus on fast action and overpowered weapons.</p>
		<p><a href="https://that1m8head.github.io/searchless">Searchless</a> - A non-search engine. Takes your search request and denies it.</p>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/That1M8Head/gh-get">gh-get</a> - A command-line utility written in C which makes cloning from GitHub easier.</p>
		<h2>About this website</h2>
		<p>I made this website because I wanted a website for myself. I've made quite a few websites, but I've only just started doing them from scratch.</p>
		<p>My <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/battlecard1232/">last</a> <a href="https://speedstriker243.wixsite.com/speedstriker243">two</a> attempts of making myself a website were all done in website builders.</p>
		<p>This website is mostly just text, formatted for easy reading.</p>
		<p>Paragraphs have line spacing, headings are tighter. Content is positioned in the middle of the browser window.</p>
		<p>If your browser detected dark mode, you'll see a dark mode. Otherwise, it'll fallback to the default light mode. If you're using <a href="https://darkreader.org/">Dark Reader</a>, set the theme generation mode to <em>Static</em>.</p>
		<p>If you want to use this page's standard CSS for your own website, insert this somewhere in the document, preferably in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:</p>
		<div class="code-block">
			&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://that1m8head.github.io/standard.css"&gt;
		</div>
		<p>If you <em>do</em> use it, please link back to this website (though you don't have to)</p>
		<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/That1M8Head/that1m8head.github.io">view the GitHub repo for this website.</a> This website contains no ads or tracking. It's hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
