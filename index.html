		<h2>About this website</h2>
		<p>
			I made this website because I wanted a website for myself.<br>
			I've made quite a few websites, but I've only just started doing them using just HTML and CSS (yep, this website has no JavaScript); my last three attempts of making myself a website were all done in website builders.
		</p>
		<p>
			This website is intentionally simplistic -- because it's part of my design philosophy for websites.<br>
			I believe the number one thing that websites should be able to do is communicate to the user through text.<br>
			Another thing in my web design philosophy is that a website should detect and apply a dark mode through CSS.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			At the same time, I don't like using simple black and white -- for light mode, it's usually a warm colour and for dark mode, it's usually a dark blue.<br>
			For this website that means <code id="colourpreview" style="color:#333444;background-color:#e9e4d2;">#333444 on #e9e4d2</code> and <code id="colourpreview" style="color:#fff;background-color:#171b25;">#ffffff on #171b25</code> for light and dark mode respectively.
