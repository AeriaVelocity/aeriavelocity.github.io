        <h2>Web design philosophy</h2>
        <p>This website may look really nice and fancy, but it's really all just CSS doing that.</p>
        <p>This website's content is actually relatively minimalist. If you <a href="../index-naked.html">took away the CSS</a>, everything would still be perfectly readable and understandable.</p>
        <p>Most of my web design philosophy comes from the Motherf-ing Websites: <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Original</a>, <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">Better</a>, <a href="https://bestmotherfucking.website/">Best</a></p>
        <p>I'm just going to go ahead and steal the format from those websites. </p>
        <h3>The Web Design Codes (patent pending)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Should be lightweight, and load fast.</li>
            <li>Fits on any screen you put it on.</li>
            <li>Looks the same in any damn browser you throw at it.</li>
            <li>Should be accessible to every single existant being who visits it.</li>
            <li>Should be legible and get your point across.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="just-text">Mostly just text</h3>
        <p>Websites are there to be read, right? So what's the point of throwing images everywhere? Websites should focus on content first, and fancy crap after. For me, I have the whole thing just be text (sans the avatar).</p>
        <h3 id="shorten-content">Shorten that content</h3>
        <p>The defaults make it so text goes edge-to-edge, which is kind of annoying if you don't have a vertical monitor. You should position your content in the middle of the screen for easier reading.</p>
        <div class="src">
            <pre>body {
    margin: auto;
    max-width: 500px;
}</pre>
        </div>
        <h3 id="text-spacing">Give the text some space</h3>
        <p>The default line spacing is kind of crap. It's super simple to make it better, though.</p>
        <div class="src">
        <pre>body {
    line-height: 1.8;
}
    h1, h2, h3 {
    /* Headings should have tighter spacing */
    line-height: 1;
}</pre>
        </div>
        <h3 id="font-size">Beef it up</h3>
        <p>It's a good idea to make the font size at least 16px, though I would personally go with 18px.</p>
        <h3 id="consistency">Have a consistent appearance</h3>
        <p>Ideally, your website should look the same across all browsers and all platforms.</p>
        <p>Having the website be just text makes this extremely easy.</p>
        <p>You will obviously need to set the viewport:</p>
        <div class="src">
        <pre>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</pre>
        </div>
        <p>You're basically done after that.</p>
        <p>You might want to add media queries to set the width smaller so it doesn't look odd on mobile devices, but otherwise no further setup is required.</p>
        <h3 id="close-to-defaults">Have it close to defaults</h3>
        <p>Websites are highly functional and optimised out of the box - website complications are usually the fault of the web designer.</p>
        <h3 id="dark-mode">Dark mode</h3>
        <p>You probably want to have a dark mode for your website.</p>
        <p>Sure, dark mode is one of the newer trendy trends, but it's actually a good idea to include.</p>
        <p>Whether you want to just make your website dark and <i>only</i> dark or have it change depending on the user's preference, it's easy to do both.</p>
        <p>For the latter, you should use <code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code>, like this:</p>
        <div class="src">
        <pre>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    body {
        color: #ffffff;
        background-color: #000000;
    }
}</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This changes the colour scheme to white on black if your browser detects dark mode from your system settings.</p>
    </body>
