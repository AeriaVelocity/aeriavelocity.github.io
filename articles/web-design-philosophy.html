            <h1>Arsalan Kazmi</h1>
        </div>
        <h2>Web design philosophy</h2>
        <p>This website may look really nice and fancy, but it's really all just CSS doing that.</p>
        <p>This website's content is actually relatively minimalist. If you <a href="../index-naked.html">took away the CSS</a>, everything would still be perfectly readable and understandable.</p>
        <p>Most of my web design philosophy comes from the Motherf-ing Websites: <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Original</a>, <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">Better</a>, <a href="https://bestmotherfucking.website/">Best</a></p>
        <p>I should probably mention that none of this is meant in malice. Go ahead and make your website extremely ugly if you want to.</p>
        <h3 id="key-things">Key things</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Should be lightweight, and load fast.</li>
            <li>Fits on any screen you put it on.</li>
            <li>Looks the same in (almost) any damn browser you throw at it.<sup>1</sup></li>
            <li>Should be accessible to every single existant being who visits it.</li>
            <li>Should be legible and get your point across.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="just-text">Mostly just text</h3>
        <p>HTML is plain text anyway, so text is fast, and accessible, and useful, and you should use text. That was a strange explanation.</p>
        <p>Do you like scrolling through massive amounts of parallax images trying to figure out what the hell it is you're meant to be reading? Yeah? Well, you're wrong. You're not designing an app, you're writing a web document.</p>
        <p>I'm supposed to make this non-offensive, aren't I?</p>
        <h3 id="shorten-content">Shorten that content</h3>
        <p>The defaults make it so text goes edge-to-edge, which sucks a lot if you're someone who uses 16:9 screens, which I'd say is most people. You should position your content in the middle of the screen for easier reading.</p>
        <p>Yeah, you <em>can</em> just run your browser in a window, buuuut, who's actually going to do that? (Most people, I'd say, lmao)</p>
        <p>This is of course optional (technically all of this is, but this more so), you don't need to do something like this.</p>
        <div class="src">
            <pre>body {
    margin: auto;
    max-width: 500px;
}</pre>
        </div>
        <h3 id="text-spacing">Give the text some space</h3>
        <p>By default, line spacing is kind of. . . really tight. If you adjust the line height, it helps for readability.</p>
        <div class="src">
        <pre>body {
    line-height: 1.8;
}
    h1, h2, h3 {
    /* Headings should have tighter spacing */
    line-height: 1;
}</pre>
        </div>
        <h3 id="font-size">Beef it up</h3>
        <p>It's a good idea to make the font size at least 16px, though I would personally go with 18px. The more readable it is, the better.</p>
        <h3 id="consistency">Have a consistent appearance</h3>
        <p>Ideally, your website should look the same across all browsers and all platforms.</p>
        <p>Having the website be just text makes this extremely easy.</p>
        <p>You will probably need to set the viewport, unless you're one of those people who dislike mobile devices:</p>
        <div class="src">
        <pre>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</pre>
        </div>
        <p>You're basically done after that.</p>
        <p>You might want to add media queries to set the width smaller so it doesn't look odd on mobile devices, but otherwise no further setup is required.</p>
        <h3 id="dark-mode">Dark mode</h3>
        <p>If you're, uh, <em>anyone</em>, and you don't want your eyes bleeding with the fury of a thousand suns every time you open your computer. . . you probably use dark mode.</p>
        <p>And you probably want to have a dark mode for your website.</p>
        <p>Whether you want to just make your website dark and <i>only</i> dark or have it change depending on the user's preference, it's easy to do both.</p>
        <p>For the latter, you should use <code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code>, like this:</p>
        <div class="src">
        <pre>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    body {
        color: #ffffff;
        background-color: #000000;
    }
}</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This changes the colour scheme to white on black if your browser detects dark mode from your system settings.</p>
        <p>In case you want to have it dark by default (so that users of browsers that don't support <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> can still have it be dark), you can do the opposite:</p>
        <pre>body {
    color: #ffffff;
    background-color: #000000;
}
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
    body {
        color: #000000;
        background-color: #ffffff;
    }
}</pre>
    <p style="font-size: small;"><sup>1</sup> almost any browser, because chances are your website isn't going to render well on a Tamagotchi. You should try to aim for cross-browser compatibility where possible, though.</p>
