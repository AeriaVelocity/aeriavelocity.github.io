** About me
I'm just a guy who's a hacker[fn:1] for fun.
I'm currently studying at [[https://www.westherts.ac.uk][West Herts College]].

I sometimes [[https://github.com/That1M8Head?tab=repositories][write software]], although it usually isn't very good. My main programming languages are C, Python and [[https://zdoom.org/wiki/ZScript][ZScript]].

I'm currently working on [[https://sonic-lockandload.github.io][Sonic: Lock & Load]], a Sonic DOOM mod built on the GZDoom source port. I also made a [[https://that1m8head.github.io/searchless][non-search engine]], for some reason.

[fn:1] "Hacker" as in, I like to experiment with computers, not that I break security systems. See [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/rms-hack.en.html]] for more info on this definition.
