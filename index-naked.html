        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Arsalan. I'm <span id="age">probably around 20</span> years old and I'm technically a software developer, but I prefer to call myself a professional computer breaker.</p>
        <p>My username for the most part is That1M8Head, and I use my old one, SpeedStriker243, if it can't be changed.</p>
        <p>You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/that1m8head">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/that1m8head">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com/@that1m8head">YouTube</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm British (specifically, I'm a Londoner), and I'm currently a student at the <a href="https://herts.ac.uk">University of Hertfordshire</a>.</p>
        <p>I like spending my time writing code, messing around with computers, playing games, making random edits, watching YouTube videos and sleeping.</p>
        <p><a href="https://sonic-lockandload.github.io">Sonic: Lock &amp; Load</a> is currently my main project, and what I work on in most of my time.</p>
