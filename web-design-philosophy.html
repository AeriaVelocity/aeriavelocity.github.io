            <h2>Web design philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                You may or may not be wondering why this website is relatively minimalist.<br />
                Most of my web design philosophy comes from the Motherf-ing Websites: <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Original</a>, <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">Better</a>, <a href="https://bestmotherfucking.website/">Best</a><br />
                I'm just going to go ahead and steal the format from those websites.
            </p>
            <h3>The Web Design Codes (patent pending)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Should be lightweight, and load fast.</li>
                <li>Fits on any screen you put it on.</li>
                <li>Looks the same in any damn browser you throw at it.</li>
                <li>Should be accessible to every single existant being who visits it.</li>
                <li>Should be legible and get your point across.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Mostly just text</h3>
            <p>Websites are there to be read, right? So what's the point of throwing images everywhere? Websites should focus on content first, and fancy crap after. For me, I have the whole thing just be text (sans the avatar).</p>
            <h3>Shorten that content</h3>
            <p>The defaults make it so text goes edge-to-edge, which is kind of annoying if you don't have a vertical monitor. You should position your content in the middle of the screen for easier reading.</p>
            <div class="src-block">
                <pre class="src src-css">body {
    margin: auto;
    max-width: 500px;
}</pre>
            </div>
            <h3>Give the text some space</h3>
            <p>
            The default line spacing is kind of crap. It's super simple to make it better, though.<br />
            </p>
            <div class="src-block">
            <pre class="src src-css">body {
    line-height: 1.8;
}
    h1, h2, h3 {
    /* Headings should have tighter spacing */
    line-height: 1;
}</pre>
            </div>
            <h3>Beef it up</h3>
            <p>
            It's a good idea to make the font size at least 16px, though I would personally go with 18px.<br />
            </p>
            <h3>Just leave the fonts as they are</h3>
            <p>
            It's usually better to set the font to the user's default serif or sans-serif font face. It loads a hell of a lot faster than if you were to connect to a server just to use a font. Your readers' browsers will thank you.<br />
            </p>
            <h3 id="org2382136">Have a consistent appearance</h3>
            <p>
            Ideally, your website should look the same across all browsers and all platforms. Having the website be just text makes this extremely easy. You will obviously need to set the viewport:<br />
            </p>
            <div class="src-block">
            <pre>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                You're basically done after that. You might want to add media queries to set the width smaller so it doesn't look odd on mobile devices, but otherwise no further setup is required.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Have it close to defaults</h3>
            <p>Websites are highly functional and optimised out of the box - website complications are usually the fault of the web designer.</p>
            <h3>Dark mode</h3>
            <p>
                You probably want to have a dark mode for your website.<br>
                Sure, dark mode is one of the newer trendy trends, but it's actually pretty good.<br>
                Whether you want to just make your website dark and <i>only</i> dark or have it change depending on the user's preference, it's easy to do both.<br>
                For the latter, you should use <code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code>, like this:
            </p>
            <div class="src-block">
            <pre>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    body {
        color: #ffffff;
        background-color: #000000;
    }
}</pre>
            </div>
            <p>This changes the colour scheme to white on black if your browser detects dark mode from your system settings.</p>
        </div>
    </body>
