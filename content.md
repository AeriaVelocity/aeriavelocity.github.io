## About me

Hi, I\'m Arsalan. I\'m [probably around 20]{#age} years old and I\'m
technically a software developer, but I prefer to call myself a
professional computer breaker.

My username for the most part is That1M8Head, and I use my old one,
SpeedStriker243, if it can\'t be changed.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/that1m8head),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/that1m8head) and
[YouTube](https://youtube.com/@that1m8head).

I\'m British (specifically, I\'m a Londoner), and I\'m currently a
student at the [University of Hertfordshire](https://herts.ac.uk).

I like spending my time writing code, messing around with computers,
playing games, making random edits, watching YouTube videos and
sleeping.

[Sonic: Lock & Load](https://sonic-lockandload.github.io) is currently
my main project, and what I work on in most of my time.

## Projects

-   [Sonic: Lock & Load](https://sonic-lockandload.github.io/), a Sonic
    the Hedgehog first-person shooter DOOM mod and fan game, which uses
    the GZDoom source port. My passion project.
-   [This
    website.](https://github.com/That1M8Head/that1m8head.github.io)
-   [sued](https://that1m8head.github.io/sued/), a line editor similar
    to the standard editor, `ed`, but significantly worse and slightly
    more user-friendly. Not finished yet, but when it is, it\'ll include
    basic text editing functionality, as well as the ability to run
    programs.
-   [Searchless](https://that1m8head.github.io/searchless/), an
    anti-search engine; takes a search result but doesn\'t search for
    anything.
-   [Take it and Like it Public
    License](https://that1m8head.github.io/tlpl/), a non-legally
    binding, not-accepted-by-any-courts super permissive software
    licence for works that you don\'t care about. Basically an informal
    version of the MIT/X licence.
