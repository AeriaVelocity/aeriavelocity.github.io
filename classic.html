		<h2>About this website</h2>
		<p>
			I made this website because I wanted a website for myself.<br>
			I've made quite a few websites, but I've only just started doing them using just HTML and CSS (yep, this website has no JavaScript); my last three attempts of making myself a website were all done in website builders.
		</p>
		<p>
			I added a Classic Mode, just because I could. Yes, there's still a dark mode. :)
